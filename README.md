Developed a smart personal assistant (chatbot) on a drone to locate people in remote areas needing immediate medical care. The chatbot identifies medical keywords from the patient's speech, provides medical advice, records the patient's pain description, and uses GPS to return to the operator with the patient's location and recording. It also analyzes chatbot technologies, speech recognition systems, and the importance of unmanned aerial vehicles.
